# Backlog

Tracks todos, bug fixes, and cleanup items that aren't part of a roadmap phase — either
surfaced by a `/code-review-and-quality` pass (or similar) on unrelated feature work, or
raised directly by Crawford as a smaller idea that doesn't warrant its own roadmap phase.
Distinct from `docs/todo/roadmap.md`, which tracks features/phases with their own
Create/Restructure/About/Docs shape.

Not a spec — this is a review-output backlog. Each item gets its own `/interview-me` or
spec pass (as warranted by its size) when picked up; check it off here once merged. Not
itself one of CLAUDE.md's Reference docs.

See also [docs/DUPLICATE_VALUE_AUDIT.md](DUPLICATE_VALUE_AUDIT.md) — a dedicated sibling
backlog for one specific bug class (independently-declared duplicate values) rather than a
duplicate of this doc.

Rewritten 2026-09-27: a full audit against git history found several fully-resolved items
still saying "not yet merged" (the underlying branches had merged months earlier — the doc
had just never been updated after the fact) and a few whose entire subject had since become
moot through later, unrelated work. Those are pruned outright below rather than kept as
closed-and-noted — git log is the record of what shipped; this file only tracks what's
still actionable. Anything genuinely still open is carried forward unchanged.

Going forward, a fully-closed item moves to [docs/todo/archive/backlog-archive.md](archive/backlog-archive.md)
instead of being pruned outright, keeping the closure's own detail around. Item numbers are
never reused or renumbered when an item moves.

## Open items

### 1. Onload: Better Power-Off Background

Requested by Crawford (`docs/todo/temp.md`), 2026-09-11. Low priority. Today, powering
off shows nothing but the static sleeve shell + rocker switch — no distinct background
art. Crawford wants to swap in something more considered, possibly one of his own
abstract paintings. Pure asset + `background` CSS swap on `SleeveContainer.css` — no
architecture impact. Blocked on Crawford supplying the artwork.

### 2. Onload: Power-Off Intro Text

Requested by Crawford (`docs/todo/temp.md`), 2026-09-11. Medium priority. Today, powering
off shows nothing but the static sleeve shell + rocker switch (`SleeveContainer.tsx` has
no off-state content at all) — a new user gets no explanation of what powering on will
do. Needs a small text block added to the off-state UI, plus actual copy explaining what
happens on power-on. Content not yet written; a placeholder can stand in until Crawford
has final copy.

### 3. Onload: Sleeve Logo

Requested by Crawford (`docs/todo/temp.md`), 2026-09-11. Medium priority.
The project name is final ("Trace Atlas") and the sleeve already shows it as a text
wordmark — a CSS `::before` pseudo-element on `.sleeve-container__bottom-strip`
(`SleeveContainer.css:116-133`, uppercased, centered), not markup in `SleeveContainer.tsx`.
Crawford wants a real image logo, bottom-right — open question whether it replaces the
text wordmark or sits alongside it. Blocked only on the logo artwork itself (a favicon
cube, `public/favicon.svg`, exists but isn't a wordmark-scale logo).

### 4. Helper Text on Inputs (Info Icon)

Requested by Crawford (`docs/todo/temp.md`), 2026-09-11. Very low priority — mainly
blocked on the amount of content (a blurb per control) needed, not on technical
complexity. `ControlSchema` (`src/types/controls.ts`) has no helper/hint-text field
today. Concept: a small "i"/"?" icon per control that reveals a short blurb about what it
does on tap/hover. Deliberately scoped small (Crawford's own call) rather than a
schema-wide addition touching all 14 primitives.

### 5. Sector Settings: AS/Coords/Favorites Reorganization

Requested by Crawford (`docs/todo/temp.md`), 2026-09-11. Medium priority. Today's
`ATTENUATION_STYLE_PRESETS` (`sectorSettingsConfig.ts`) is what Crawford means by
"favorites" — same concept, different name; not a new feature so much as a reframing
plus a data refresh. Crawford has been separately keeping his own list of good
Attenuation Style + coordinate combinations; once roadmap Phase 21 (Sector Settings:
Shareable Link Import/Export) lands, he wants to update the in-app preset list with
current, shareable links, alongside reorganizing how AS/coordinates/presets are laid
out in the Sector Settings panel. Depends on Phase 21 for the "shareable link" half —
Session Storage (Phase 20) alone only makes a link possible via the address bar, not
an in-app Export/Import action.

### 6. Audio: Groove Feature

Requested by Crawford (`docs/todo/temp.md`), 2026-09-11. Low priority — deprioritized
behind launch. A new mechanic: a "groove" value that raises the odds of robots syncing
their rhythm to other robots while docked/recharging. Would touch `robotSystems.ts`'s
docking logic and melody/rhythm generation. Not yet scoped — open question is whether
"groove" is a single global dial (e.g. a Sector Settings or Audio Rig control) or a
per-robot/per-locale value.

Note (2026-10-06): roadmap Phase 43 puts docked robots inside 2–3 charging stations (capacity 6
each), so the robots sharing a station are a natural grouping for "who syncs with whom".

### 7. Audio: More Chord Progressions + Selection UI

Requested by Crawford (`docs/todo/temp.md`), 2026-09-11. Low priority — deprioritized
behind launch. `HARMONY_PALETTES` (`harmonySystem.ts`) is a fixed array, sequentially
cycled automatically (the `feature/harmony-palette-update` rewrite — see project memory
— is confirmed merged) with no user-facing selection at all. Adding more palettes is
straightforward; adding a way to choose them is the real feature — needs a new UI
control, location not yet decided (Sector Settings vs. Audio Rig are the likely
candidates).

### 8. Visuals: Job Animations

Requested by Crawford (`docs/todo/temp.md`), 2026-09-11. Medium priority — deprioritized
behind launch. `JobType` (`Robot.ts`, see `docs/ROBOT_LIFECYCLE.md`) exists and is shown
as data/text (`RobotSelectionCard`, `RobotDisplaySection`), but nothing in the
actor-rendering layer visually differentiates a robot by its current job today. Genuinely
new visual work; not yet scoped.

**Superseded (2026-10-06)** by roadmap Phase 43, Robot Jobs and Charging Stations
([docs/ideas/robot-jobs-and-stations.md](../ideas/robot-jobs-and-stations.md)): orbiters detach
and play the job's moves at a host building. Move this item to the archive when Phase 43 ships.

### 9. Visuals: Better Building Details

Requested by Crawford (`docs/todo/temp.md`), 2026-09-11. Low priority — deprioritized
behind launch. Factories already have a real system to extend (`docs/BUILDING_DESIGN.md`:
silhouette base + rooftop greebles + seeded facade/window/color variation) — scope is
more likely additional greeble/variant variety within that existing system than a
structural change, but not yet confirmed with Crawford.

### 10. Visuals: Atmospheric Animations

Requested by Crawford (`docs/todo/temp.md`), 2026-09-11. Medium priority — deprioritized
behind launch. No weather/atmosphere/particle system exists in `WorldView` today — this
would be genuinely new (fog, dust, light rays, precipitation, or similar — not yet
specified). Not yet scoped.

### 11. Visuals: Small Immersion Animations

Requested by Crawford (`docs/todo/temp.md`), 2026-09-11. Low priority — deprioritized
behind launch. Likely a grab-bag of minor polish (idle bobs, blinking lights, and similar
small touches) rather than a single feature; exact list not yet defined.

### 13. SVG: Invalid Empty `y` Attribute — Live-Browser Confirmation Outstanding

**Status:** fix merged to `main` via PR #469 (`7eb1f67`), 2026-09-15 — confirmed still
present at `PowerRockerSwitch.tsx:314` (`y={POWER_SVG_REST.y}`). Only the live-browser
confirmation remains genuinely open; no evidence since of that check having happened.

`PowerRockerSwitch.tsx`'s nested `.rocker-power-svg` (the power icon inside the rocker
switch) was the one element in the codebase whose `y` position was never set in JSX at
all — set only by `useGSAP`'s `gsap.set(powerSvgEl, { attr: { y: POWER_SVG_REST.y } })` on
mount, so on the very first paint the attribute was absent/invalid. The fix gives the
`<svg>` an explicit `y` default in JSX so a valid value exists from the very first paint;
GSAP still owns the tween from there. Covered by a `PowerRockerSwitch.test.tsx` regression
test. **Not yet confirmed in a live browser** — the hypothesis is strong (the one
component matching the bug's exact shape) but the real Chrome console output was never
watched directly for it.

### 14. Live-Profiler Reverification Still Pending (3 spots)

The `refactor/factory-timing` performance series (merged to `main` via PR #465, `e55e846`,
2026-09-14/15) fixed a long chain of re-render bugs — most were live-verified with
Crawford and React DevTools Profiler at the time and are fully closed. Three specific
fixes in that same series still haven't gotten their own live-Profiler recheck:

- **`RobotBody`'s lighting/audio-shape split** (`RobotBody.tsx` — `audioVisual` vs.
  `colors` memos) — code fix landed and unit-tested (a regression spy confirmed the
  wasted recompute before the fix), but never re-checked live in the Profiler the way the
  sibling `Factory`/`BubbleStream` fixes were.
- **Once/sec lighting-tick batching smoothness** (`AttenuationStyleView.tsx`'s
  `React.startTransition` wrap) — doesn't reduce total work, only lets React spread/
  interrupt it; whether the commit visibly spreads across multiple frames now (and feels
  less spiky) still needs a live look.
- **`RobotOptionsTab`/`CompanyOptionsSection` memoization** — the fix and its cascade
  regression tests are merged and passing, but note the file shape has since moved on:
  both components were later rewritten to render through a shared
  `RobotSectionAccordionStack` (roadmap Phase 28, Robot Section/Subsection Config
  Consolidation) — any specific file:line citations from the original fix are stale, but
  the underlying stabilized-callback/memo pattern is confirmed still present (a `// Task 6`
  comment referencing the original fix survives the restructure). Re-verify against
  current code, not old line numbers, when this gets checked.

### 15. Test Suite: Three Tests Fail Intermittently Under a Full Parallel Run

**Status:** ☐ open — noticed 2026-09-18, still reproducing as of 2026-09-28 (see project
memory: known-flaky unmocked-random tests).

Four tests fail occasionally in a full `npx vitest run` and pass every time when their own file is run alone (3–5 isolated runs each):

- `src/systems/audioSwells.test.ts` › *pingVarianceAutomation forced return at 0% (Task 4) › forces every member of a company-wide swell together, sharing phase/timing, each landing exactly on its own baseValue* — failed in 4 of 7 full runs.
- `src/components/company/CompanyCrudControls.test.tsx` › *Rename Submit button › is (normally) enabled immediately after selecting a company — the auto-suggested draft differs from the current name* — failed in 2 full runs, one of them on the commit *before* any 17.2.2 work.
- `src/systems/factoryPlacementSystem.test.ts` › *recolorFactoriesForAttenuationStyle › changes only config.hueShift/config.satShift on every factory — everything else round-trips byte-identical* — failed in 1 full run.
- `src/systems/worldTransition.test.ts` › *initializeLocale › fully clears in-flight swells on a second `initializeLocale` call — no swell survives a restart* — failed 1 full run, seen 2026-09-28 during Session Storage (Phase 20) Task 12 verification; passed immediately on an isolated re-run.

All known failures since (per project memory) are real-RNG preconditions, not assertion
bugs — re-run once to confirm rather than retry-looping or editing assertions. All four
suggest a shared, load- or order-dependent input (wall-clock time, seeded randomness that
isn't fully pinned, or a timing-sensitive assertion). Worth a look before a CI gate is
added (there is none yet — see `CLAUDE.md`'s PR process note), since a flaky gate trains
people to re-run instead of read.

### 17. Audit: LFO Drift / Audio Swells / Ping Variance — Replayability Findings

Task 8 of `docs/tasks/WORLD_CLOCK_DETERMINISTIC_LIFECYCLE_REPLAY.md` (roadmap Phase 20.5),
2026-09-28. Non-blocking, informational — nothing here was fixed as part of this audit, and
nothing in it blocked Phase 20.5's own deliverable (battery/docking/job/melody-drift
replay), which is independently proven regardless of these findings. Recorded so a future
phase wanting to replay/reproduce *audio* state (not just robot lifecycle) knows exactly
what it's dealing with, rather than assuming "everything here is already measure-quantized"
and discovering otherwise mid-implementation.

**`src/systems/audioSwells.ts` — trigger/target logic is safe; ramp interpolation isn't
(and doesn't need to be, a precedent already exists).** Its scheduling is
`scheduleRepeat('16n', () => tickAudioSwells(localeId, getCurrentMeasurePrecise()))`
(line 406) — Transport-driven, measure-based, never a raw `setTimeout`/`setInterval`. Every
trigger-probability and target-selection roll (`getSeededVal(noiseMap, 'audioSwell.*', measure,
...)`, lines 530-669) is seeded by `(noiseMap, measure)` — zero `Math.random`, zero
`Date.now()` anywhere in the file (confirmed by direct search, not assumed). *Deciding
whether/which/when a swell starts* is therefore fully deterministic and replayable from
elapsed measures alone. What is **not** replayable: a swell's own in-flight `rampTo`
interpolation is real Web Audio time, not measure time — the literal value at some
arbitrary mid-ramp moment depends on real elapsed seconds since the ramp started, which
`stepRobotLifecycle`-style measure replay has no way to reconstruct. This is not a new
problem or a gap to fix here: `sessionDiff.ts`'s `extractSwellBaseValueIfActive`/
`extractGlobalSwellBaseValueIfActive` (added for Session Storage, see
`docs/todo/backlog.md`'s own history and `docs/SESSION_STORAGE.md`) already solve exactly
this by capturing a swell's normalized *target* value instead of its mid-ramp interpolated
one at save time. Any future phase wanting swell state to survive a World-Clock-style
replay should reuse that same normalize-to-target-value technique, not invent a new one.

**`src/engine/lfoEngine.ts` — NOT replayable from elapsed measures, by design, and this is
correct as shipped.** `Tone.LFO` nodes (line 199, `new Tone.LFO(settings.rate)`) are real,
continuous audio-rate oscillators driven by the Web Audio clock itself — their phase at any
moment is a function of real elapsed wall-clock time since the node started, not of
elapsed measures. The manual phase-polling fallback (`startPhaseFallback`, lines 283-298)
makes this explicit in code: `const startTime = Tone.now()`, then every poll computes
`const elapsed = Tone.now() - startTime; const angle = 2 * Math.PI * settings.rate * elapsed`
— a textbook real-time oscillator, scheduled via `scheduleRepeat('16n', ...)` (measure-cadenced
*polling*, but the *math inside* is real-seconds-based, not measure-based). This is
deliberate, confirmed-intended behavior — the file's own doc comment states LFO `rate`
must stay "a free-running Hz value," explicitly *not* tempo/transport-coupled (`sync()` is
deliberately never called, for this exact reason). **Consequence for any future World Clock
consumer:** reproducing "the exact LFO phase at this moment" needs real elapsed wall-clock
time tracked as its own primitive — `createdAtMeasure`/elapsed-measures alone cannot derive
it, since measures and real seconds are only loosely related via BPM and an LFO's own
`startTime` is a real timestamp, not a measure count. Not a bug — a different kind of state
than robot lifecycle, requiring a different (not yet built) mechanism if it's ever needed.

**"Ping variance automation" is not a separate timing/randomness system — nothing to audit
independently.** It's a single scalar (`audioStore.pingVarianceAutomation`, read at
`audioSwells.ts:467`) that feeds into audio swells' own already-covered, already-safe
trigger-probability math as one more input value. No independent scheduling mechanism, no
independent randomness source, no separate file.

**Summary for a future reader:** robot lifecycle (this phase) and audio-swell
trigger/targeting are both genuinely measure-replayable today. LFO phase is not, and
correctly so — it would need a real-elapsed-time primitive this phase deliberately doesn't
build (out of scope, see `docs/intent/world-clock-deterministic-lifecycle-replay.md`). Swell
ramp interpolation is "not replayable" in the same sense LFO phase is, but has an existing,
reusable fix (normalize to target value) already proven by Session Storage.
