# Backlog Archive

Closed items moved out of [docs/todo/backlog.md](../backlog.md) to keep that file focused on
what's still open. Item numbers are preserved exactly as they were assigned in the live backlog
— never renumbered on archive — so any existing cross-reference stays valid. Entries appear in
their original numeric order, not archive-date order.

## 8. Visuals: Job Animations

Requested by Crawford (`docs/todo/temp.md`), 2026-09-11. Medium priority — deprioritized
behind launch. `JobType` (`Robot.ts`, see `docs/ROBOT_LIFECYCLE.md`) exists and is shown
as data/text (`RobotSelectionCard`, `RobotDisplaySection`), but nothing in the
actor-rendering layer visually differentiates a robot by its current job today. Genuinely
new visual work; not yet scoped.

**Closed** 2026-10-08 by roadmap Phase 43, Robot Jobs and Charging Stations (all four branches merged,
J4 = PR #544). Robots now work at host buildings: their orbiters detach and play one of six jobs'
moves (`hoverPulse`, `trace`, `ring`, `fan`, `carry`), so what a robot is doing shows in the world,
not only on its card. See [docs/ROBOT_LIFECYCLE.md](../../ROBOT_LIFECYCLE.md) and
[docs/ANIMATION_SYSTEM.md](../../ANIMATION_SYSTEM.md#job-moves).

## 12. IdleSystem: console.warn Fires on the Ordinary Case, Not an Error

**Closed** 2026-09-30 (`6c4657e`, branch `fixes/idlesystem-noise-wordltransition-bug`). Narrowed
`idleSystem.ts`'s guard to warn only when the robot is genuinely missing from the store
(`!robot`) — the actually-unexpected case — instead of on every non-Idle/Active state, which
most robots hit on every locale load simply by spawning Docked. Covered by new regression tests
in `idleSystem.test.ts` asserting `console.warn` fires for a missing robot and stays silent for
every ordinary docking/state combination.

## 16. `worldTransition.ts`: Retransmitting the Currently-Active Attenuation Style's Own Name Corrupts the Store

**Closed** 2026-09-30 (`fixes/idlesystem-noise-wordltransition-bug`, same branch as #12 above).
`createNewAttenuationStyle` now checks `addAttenuationStyle`'s boolean return and, on a
case-insensitive name collision, looks up and reuses the real existing entry instead of
proceeding with a phantom, never-added one. `finalizeAttenuationStyleTransition` additionally
guards its own `removeAttenuationStyle` call against the self-collision case — reusing the
*currently active* entry (a caller resubmitting its own current name, the bug's original
trigger) would otherwise delete the very entry just reused. Fixes the root cause directly in
`worldTransition.ts`, not just at the one caller (`sessionDiff.ts`) that had worked around it
before. Covered by new regression tests in `worldTransition.test.ts` (`describe('retransmitWorld
— Attenuation Style name collision')`) recreating both the "different existing entry" and
"resubmits its own current name" collisions directly, confirming `selectCurrentAttenuationStyle`
no longer dangles to `undefined` in either case. The previously-flagged "not covered by the
workaround" scope note is resolved by this fix; the deeper bookkeeping question this item's
own "needs its own scoping pass" caveat raised (what happens to the *reused* entry's own
previously-current locale) remains genuinely open but is now a documented, intentional
limitation rather than silent corruption — see the fix's own doc comments.
